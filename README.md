# jump61
Project 2 of CS61B Fall 2021

Background from class website: 
"The KJumpingCube game1 is a two-person board game. It is a pure strategy game, involving no element of chance. For this third project, you are to implement our version of this game, which we'll call jump61b, allowing a user to play against a computer or against another person, or to allow the computer to play itself. The tested interface is textual, but for extra credit, you can produce a GUI interface for the game."
